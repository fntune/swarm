"""Executor ABC and runtime registry.

An ``Executor`` drives one vendor's agent SDK. Given an ``AgentConfig``
(what to run) and a ``Toolset`` (what tools the agent may use), the
executor spawns the vendor client, streams iterations, persists status
and cost to SQLite, and returns a result dict the scheduler consumes.
